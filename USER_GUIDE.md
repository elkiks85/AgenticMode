- **Core Agents**: Start AGENT_MANAGER, CLIENT, ORCHESTRATOR
- **Development Team**: Start all 5 dev agents
- **Support Team**: Start all 9 support agents
- **Dashboard**: Start the web dashboard

### Running Tasks
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type: `run task`
3. Select the task you want

### Terminal Management
- **Create Terminal**: `` Ctrl+` ``
- **Split Terminal**: `Ctrl+Shift+5`
- **Switch Terminals**: `Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown`
- **Rename Terminal**: Right-click tab â†’ Rename
- **Color Code**: Right-click tab â†’ Change Color

### Pro Tips
1. Save your terminal layout: File â†’ Save Workspace As
2. Name terminals after agents for easy identification
3. Use color coding: Red for core, Yellow for dev, Green for support

---

## Dashboard

### Starting the Dashboard
```bash
# Option 1: Direct command
cd Dashboard && npm run dev

# Option 2: Batch file
./start-dashboard.bat

# Option 3: VS Code task
Run task: "Start Dashboard"
```

2. In CLIENT terminal, choose:
   - `1` or `new project` - Create new project
   - `2` or `status` - Check project status
   - `3` or `list` - List all projects
   - `help` - Show all commands

### Project Workflow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Command 'claude' not found"
- Ensure Claude Code is installed
- Add Claude to system PATH
- Restart terminal after installation

#### Only some agents start
- VS Code has terminal limits
- Start agents individually or in smaller groups
- Close unused terminals first

#### Agent not responding
- Wait for Claude to fully load before typing agent name
- Make sure you typed exactly: `You are [AGENT_NAME]`
- Check if agent files exist in AGENTS directory

#### Dashboard connection issues
- Ensure backend is running on port 3001
- Check if port is already in use: `taskkill /F /IM node.exe`
- Verify frontend is on port 3000

#### Agents can't find each other
- Ensure all agents are in same directory
- Check COMMUNICATION folder permissions
- Verify message files are being created

### Reset Commands
```bash
# Kill all Node processes (Windows)
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Clear communication folder
rm COMMUNICATION/MESSAGES/*.md

# Reset agent states
rm AGENTS/*/STATE.md
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Order**: Always start core agents first
2. **Terminal Names**: Rename terminals to agent names
3. **Message Monitoring**: Check COMMUNICATION folder for issues
4. **Regular Saves**: Save VS Code workspace layout
5. **Resource Management**: Close unused agents to free resources

## Next Steps

1. Start with core agents and CLIENT
2. Create a test project to understand the flow
3. Gradually add more agents as needed
4. Use Dashboard for monitoring
5. Customize agents for your needs
